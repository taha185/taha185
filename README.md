# About Me
Hi, I'm Taha, a 15-year-old from Morocco. I'm passionate about programming and technology, constantly learning and experimenting with code. I may still be at the beginning of my programming journey, but I'm eager to grow and improve. I love working on small projects and challenging myself to learn new languages and techniques. My goal is to keep pushing my skills forward and contribute to the tech community. Feel free to check out my repositories and follow my progress!
